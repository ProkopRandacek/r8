Rewrite from scratch wip

# R8 Engine

## [Docs](./docs.md)

## TODO
- `[#...]` Docs
  - `[###.]` Design
  - `[....]` API

## Building
The usual `./configure && make`. Binary is in `run/bin/`.

## Deps
R8 depends on [libucw](http://www.ucw.cz/libucw/) and [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).  
You can install both of these if you have Arch: `yay -S raylib libucw --needed`. Alternatively you can download/compile and install them manually.
