# R8 Engine

## TODO
- [ ] Docs

## Building
The usual `./configure && make`. Binary is in `run/bin/`.

## Deps
R8 depends on [libucw](http://www.ucw.cz/libucw/) and [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).  
You can install both of these if you have Arch: `yay -S raylib libucw --needed`. Alternatively you can download/compile and install them manually.
