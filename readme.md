# R8 Engine

## TODO
- [ ] Docs

## Building
R8 is build using the [libucw](http://www.ucw.cz/libucw/)'s build system so you need it installed to build R8. You can clone, compile and install it manually, or run the [`getucw`](./getucw) script to do it automatically.  
R8 also requires raylib. Ideally, you would install raylib with `yay -S raylib`. Alternatively you can compile/download and install raylib from source manually.  

### Build dependencies
- make
- libucw
- pkg-config
