# Implementation

## Primitives serialization

Primitives are all serialized into array of 12 floats. Not all floats are always used.

## SDF optimalization

There is the true expansive sdf created by the user. Then there is a second
very cheap sdf that is generated by r8 at build that completly contains the true sdf.

The true sdf is called only when the cheap sdf returns a small enough value.
